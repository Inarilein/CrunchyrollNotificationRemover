## Description

A Chrome extension, to hiding the annoying red notification bubble, if you're logged in on Crunchyroll. Also works on Opera. Yes, I know there are some notification settings, but for some reasons, this still shows up, so I decided to create a plugin, to hide it.

## Installation

1. Download the code or clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/crunchyroll-notification-hider.git
   ```
2. Open Google Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Activate developer mode (top right)
4. Click on "Load unpacked extension" and select the CrunchyrollNotificationRemover folder
